## üìñ Design Notes

### ‚úÖ Validation

* Defined in Zod schemas shared between client and server
* Validations include field length, required/optional rules, and cross-field checks (e.g., budgetMax ‚â• budgetMin)

### ‚úÖ SSR vs Client

* List page (`/buyers`) is server-rendered with real pagination, sorting, and filtering for performance and SEO
* Forms use client-side validation for instant feedback but fall back to server checks for safety

### ‚úÖ Ownership Enforcement

* On edit/delete operations, the server checks if the `ownerId` matches the logged-in user
* Others are allowed read access but not modification

### ‚úÖ Rate Limiting

* Simple in-memory store limits per IP/user on create/update routes
